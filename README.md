# PSG-Revamped
Painting Selection Gui Revamped

Original code by DavidGoldman here :  
https://github.com/DavidGoldman/PaintingSelectionGui  
https://github.com/DavidGoldman/GuiLib  


Paintings++'s Upgrade to json based painting templates for maximum personalization has had both
PSG and Paintings++ merged into one mod. 

The code for PSG has retained it's structure and code, as well as Goldman's package names, but can
be viewed up to date at https://github.com/ArtixAllMighty/Paintings--
